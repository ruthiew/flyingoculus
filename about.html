                <p>The Flying Oculus is a joint creative effort by Emily Williams and Ruth Naddy.</p>
                <p>It started as an idea to build a world with all the things that we enjoyed: adventure stories, interesting and unique characters, steampunk and fantasy aesthetics, alternative histories and imaginative environments, with no boundaries attaching the project to a genre. But most of all, it was an excuse to bring together two creative passions, writing and illustration, and have some fun.</p>
                <p>We hope you enjoy the adventure!</p>
